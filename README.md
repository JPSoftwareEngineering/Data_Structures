# Data Structures in C Sharp

## What Are Enumerators?

Enumerators are used to read data in the collection, i.e. they can enumerate (go through/mention one by one) everything in a collection of data.

In C#, all collections (eg lists, dictionaries, stacks, queues etc) are enumerable because they implement the IEnumerable interface. You can iterate
over a string using a foreach block to get every character in the string.
